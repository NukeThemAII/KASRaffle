# Agent Log — KASRaffle

## 2024-05-18
- Initial repo inspection completed. Current layout is a flat root directory with `KASRaffle.sol`, `KASRaffle.t.sol`, `AGENTS.md`, and `README.md`; Scaffold-ETH monorepo structure is not yet in place.
- Existing `KASRaffle.sol` is a rough sketch. It does not compile (`tierBps = new uint16;` etc.), lacks many guardrails, and mixes placeholder logic (e.g., participant array updates, rollover accounting). We'll plan to rebuild this contract to align with the spec instead of patching the stub.
- Foundry tests are placeholders without assertions. No deployment script or frontend assets exist.
- Next steps will set up the proper `/packages/forge` and `/packages/next` directories, re-implement the contract (storage layout, lifecycle, randomness, accounting), and draft comprehensive tests.
- Open questions to resolve soon: keeper tip funding model, rollover handling when round voids, and efficient participant tracking for large rounds.

### Immediate TODOs
1. Scaffold repo into `/packages/forge` and `/packages/next` per AGENTS.md; migrate existing stubs accordingly.
2. Reimplement `KASRaffle` contract with validated parameters, participant bookkeeping, drawing/refund flows, keeper incentives, and strict accounting helpers.
3. Build Foundry test suite covering happy path, refund path, edge cases, fuzz, and accounting invariant.
4. Add deploy script `Deploy.s.sol` with environment-driven config and logging.
5. Set up Next.js app shell with home/history/admin routes, wagmi hooks stubbed out against the contract ABI.
6. Define CI/testing scripts (forge test, lint/typecheck placeholders) in package manifests.

## 2024-05-18 (cont.)
- Restructured repository into Scaffold-ETH inspired layout under `/packages`, migrating Solidity sources/tests/scripts into `/packages/forge`.
- Rebuilt `packages/forge/src/KASRaffle.sol` to align with AGENTS.md: deterministic rollover handling, chunked finalize/refund flows, keeper tipping, strict accounting, and CEI protections. Added minimal local OpenZeppelin stubs (Ownable/Pausable/ReentrancyGuard/SafeCast) due to restricted networking.
- Authored comprehensive Foundry test suite (`packages/forge/test/KASRaffle.t.sol`) covering countdown start, caps, refund path, happy-path finalization & claims, admin controls, pausing, and an invariant harness enforcing accounting bounds.
- Added deployment script `packages/forge/script/Deploy.s.sol` and Foundry config.
- Blocked on fetching upstream dependencies and solc binaries because of sandboxed network; future agents should run `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.0.2` and ensure solc 0.8.24 is available (or reuse provided stubs) before executing tests.

### Frontend & Workspace Progress
- Added pnpm workspace configuration and Next.js (App Router) package with Tailwind/RainbowKit setup. Providers include wagmi, React Query, and theme handling.
- Implemented core wagmi hooks (buy/close/finalize/refund/claim, admin writes, read helpers) and utilities for formatting & countdowns.
- Created initial UI scaffolding:
  * `/` active round dashboard with ticket purchasing, lifecycle controls, and claim prompt.
  * `/history` viewer for past rounds with winner list navigation.
  * `/admin` fee management + pause controls (parameter form still TODO; call `setParams` manually meanwhile).
- Note: `forge test` still fails inside the harness because it cannot download solc binaries (DNS blocked). Tests must be executed from an environment with offline solc cache.

## 2024-05-18 (cont.)
- Extended `KASRaffle.sol` with `getTierBps`/`tierBpsLength` view helpers for UI + test support; ABI updated accordingly.
- Added Hooks: `useSetParams`, `useTierBps`, `useParticipantsCount`, plus a fuller admin form to drive `setParams` with validation and success/error states.
- Implemented `/leaderboard` page pulling on-chain participant slices and winners for ad-hoc analytics; wired pagination controls (50 accounts per fetch).
- `/admin` now covers parameter tuning, fee withdrawals, fee vault updates, and pause toggles; README reflects pnpm workspace usage and front-end routes.
- Current gap: Foundry tests still blocked in-sandbox until `solc 0.8.24` is cached; run `forge test` off-box or vendor the compiler binary.

### 2024-05-18 — Testing & Frontend Install Attempts
- Tried `forge test`; hit missing `forge-std`/`solc` resources inside sandbox. Added minimal stubs to keep compilation flowing, but real runs still require a networked environment to install `foundry-rs/forge-std` and cache solc 0.8.24.
- `pnpm install` fails without npm registry access. Frontend execution (`pnpm --filter kasraffle-web dev`) remains unverified until dependencies are fetched from `registry.npmjs.org` (or mirrored).
- README now documents the dependency bootstrapping steps plus troubleshooting notes for offline shells.
